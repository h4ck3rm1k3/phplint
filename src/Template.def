FUNCTION ParseClassDeclTemplate(): ARRAY OF Class
(*
	Parse class declaration template part:
	class HashMap /*. <K implements Hashable; E> .*/ ...
	On entry sym = sym_x_lt.
	Parameters:
	class_name: FQN of the template class.
	Return: Parsed surrogate classes. The names of the surrogate
	classes (K and E in the example above) takes the current namespace
	to build a FQN. It is responsability of the client to "mangle"
	these names in some way to avoid collisions with surrogate classes
	in the same namespace. The following function does just this.
*)


FUNCTION MangleNamesOfSurrogateClasses(main_class: Class,
	surrogates: ARRAY OF Class)
(*
	Mangles the names of the surrogate classes to avoid collisions
	with other surrogate classes in the same namespace. For example:
	class HashMap /*. <K implements Hashable; E> .*/ ...
	the surrogate classes are K,E in the same namespace of HashMap,
	that is some\ns\K and some\ns\E; these names are changed
	appending "@HashMap", so that the names becomes
	some\ns\K@HashMap and some\ns\E@HashMap respectively.
