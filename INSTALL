PHPLint - INSTALLATION

0. WHAT YOU WILL NEED TO BUILD PHPLINT
======================================

- A computer with a C compiler. M2 is known to work under Linux,
  Solaris and Windows+Cygwin.

- The "Conservative Garbage Collector"
  (www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/), a library to handle memory
  allocation and automatic garbage collecting.

- The M2 development system (www.icosaedro.it/m2/). M2 is a cross-compiler
  from the M2 language to the C language. Compile and install according
  to the instructions indicated there.

- The source of PHPLint. If you are reading this file, you already
  have it :-)

A "pure-C" version of PHPLint is also available: it do not require the
garbage collector nor the M2 development system, but still it requires a
C compiler and possibly the Cygwin system (Windows only).


1. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
======================
I developed PHPLint on a Pentium 4 system with 256 MB of RAM, 40 GB HD,
running the Slackware 10.0 operating system. However it should build on any
GNU/Linux system and most of the others Unix-like systems.  Others programs
are needed that are commonly available on those systems, as gcc, make, and so
on. Cygwin provide the same development environment under the Windows system.


2. COMPILING
============
Once the garbage collector and the M2 development system are installed,
you can compile PHPLint with these commands:

	make
	make install

The last command is not really necessary, since PHPLint do not need to be
installed on a particular place, but it will give you some hints.
The final result of the compilation is the executable program "src/phplint".
Once compiled, all you need is the executable file "phplint" itself and the
directory "modules/" to be passed as argument --modules-path.


3. FIRST EXECUTION
==================

$ echo "<?php echo 'hello world'; ?>" > test.php
$ src/phplint test.php

or using the GUI version:

$ ./phplint.tk test.php


5. HOW TO CONTINUE
==================

Please read the tutorial first (doc/tutorial.html) then the chapter "Usage"
of the manual (doc/manual.html): the simple script "phpl" suggested there
is very useful for daily usage of PHPLint.

And do not forget to check for new versions of the program from time to time,
since it is evolving very quickly:

BUGS REPORT
===========

PHPLint becomes more and more complex, while PHP is a moving target, so any
help would be very appreciated.

The manual explicitly states that some feature are still missing, and some
others will never be implemented because against the general phylosophy of
the PHPLint project.

If you really found a bug or a missing feature, please drop a message to
me at <phplint@icosaedro.it>.

Before actually send the message, don't forget to indicate any information
that may be useful, for example:

- The operating system you are using (name and version).

- The version of PHPLint.

- The (possibly shortest) sample of code that reproduce the problem.

- The report generated by PHPLint and the command you used.

- Possibly the HTML document generated (if significant for the issue).

- The expected/desired result.

Most of these informations can be easily generated with these commands:

  $ cp sample.php bug.txt
  $ src/phplint --modules-path modules/ --version sample.php 2>&1 >> bug.txt

then attach the file bug.txt so generated to your email. I can't promise
to reply immediately, but I will try to do my best.


That's all, enjoy!
