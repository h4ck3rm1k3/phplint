Test list for PHPLint
---------------------

This is the "poor-man" test suite of PHPLint.



run-tests
=========

This script scan for the PHP source files inside the list/ directory, generates
a PHPLint report, then compares the result with the old report.

If differences are found, diffs are shown and then asks the user in order to
confirm, reject or repeat the test.

If a new source file gets found, the report is generated then displays the
report and asks for confirmation.

The same script work as a "batch" job if the "batch" argument is provided, then
it exits with an error status (1) if differences were found. Normally it should
be invoked with "make test" from the base directory of the package.

Use tkdiff if available, otherwise use diff in side-by-side layout. Use
mousepad as editor if available, otherwise "less".

list/
=====

This dir. contains some test sources that are read by run-tests.

Every source file name MUST have the structure

4-*.php  (PHP 4 specific test)
5-*.php  (PHP 5 specific test)

Since PHP 4 is mostly a subset of PHP 5, PHP 5 tests are also good PHP 4 tests.

For every n-*.php the run-tests script will generate the corresponding
n-*.report file containing the stdout+stderr of the PHPLint output.

To add new tests, simply add the source to this directory following the
naming scheme detailed here, then launch run-test.

That's all!
